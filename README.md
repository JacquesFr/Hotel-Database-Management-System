# Hotel-Database-Management-System

In this project, you will model and build a hotel database management system. This system is to
track information about different hotels, such as the rooms they own, the maintenance of those
rooms, the managers they employ, the bookings their customers make, and information about the
customers that use the hotel services.

The project comprises three phases. In Phase 1, you will perform requirement analysis using the
ER-model, given a set of requirements for your database. Please note that you are being given only
a set of requirements, not the entities or actual set of attributes that go with each entity. In Phase 2
of this project, you will design a logical model of your database using the ER-model. In Phase 3,
you will implement the database, and exercise your design using queries.
You will work on Phases 1 and 2 alone. Phase 3 is to be completed with a partner. Submit all your
files via iLearn on the due date for each phase. Each submission should be a single zip file. Make
sure that everything is included in your submission and it can be uncompressed without any errors.

Phase 1: ER Design
From the description given, first identify the entity sets in your model, and the attributes for each
entity set, as required by the specifications and queries. Next, produce an ER-diagram that will
serve as the foundation for the rest of the design. You can create this diagram using your favorite
diagram editing software. Your model should use only the basic ER model features, and include
entities, attributes, and relationships. Ensure that you capture all participation and key constraints.
Also, make sure to include additional documentation describing the assumptions that you made
during the design process
